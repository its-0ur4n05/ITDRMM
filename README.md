# ITDR Maturity Model Toolkit

A practical framework to help organizations assess and improve their **Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR)** capabilities, especially in hybrid and on-prem environments (e.g., IDC).

If you have any questions or are interested in collaborating, feel free to contact me at: its0ur4n05@gmail.com

## Overview
This maturity model helps teams benchmark their ITDR readiness across **five maturity levels** and **four capability dimensions**. It's designed to be:

- Technology-agnostic
- Usable for cloud, hybrid, and on-prem (IDC) environments
- Practical for SOCs, blue teams, and security architects

## Maturity Levels

| Level | Description                         |
|-------|-------------------------------------|
| L0    | **Nonexistent** - No ITDR capability |
| L1    | **Reactive** - Basic visibility & passive detection |
| L2    | **Baseline** - Defined coverage & manual response processes |
| L3    | **Active** - Real-time detection & integrated response |
| L4    | **Adaptive** - Fully automated, intelligent, risk-based ITDR

### Level Descriptions (Detailed)

#### ðŸ”´ L0 - Nonexistent
- No dedicated effort toward identity threat detection
- No identity inventory or privilege separation
- No logging or visibility into identity activities
- Attackers can persist undetected indefinitely

#### ðŸŸ  L1 - Reactive
- Initial efforts to collect identity-related logs (e.g., AD logs)
- Limited visibility over key users or critical accounts
- Alerts sent via email or basic ticketing, but no structured response
- No standardized roles or responsibilities for identity incidents
- Detection mostly occurs *after* an incident or external report

#### ðŸŸ¡ L2 - Baseline
- Basic inventory of accounts and identity-asset mapping exists
- Detection rules in place for common abuse patterns (e.g., login anomalies)
- Security team responds using SOPs: manual account disable, reset password, etc.
- Incidents logged and escalated based on severity
- Detection-to-response linkage starts forming but is still mostly manual

#### ðŸŸ¢ L3 - Active
- Comprehensive identity inventory with privileged tracking and session logs
- Real-time detection rules with behavioral analytics or baselines
- Integration with SOAR for partial automation of response workflows
- Response actions include contextual decisions based on role or criticality
- Threat hunting for identity misuse starts to become systematic

#### ðŸ”µ L4 - Adaptive
- Risk-based identity protection and dynamic response policies
- Detection enriched by ML/graph/LLM-based analysis
- Continuous feedback loop between detection, investigation, and policy tuning
- Automated remediation with minimal human intervention (e.g., auto-MFA challenges, just-in-time access revocation)
- Unified visibility across hybrid/cloud/on-prem identity infrastructure

## Capability Dimensions

| Dimension            | L0 - Nonexistent | L1 - Reactive | L2 - Baseline | L3 - Active | L4 - Adaptive |
|----------------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Identity Visibility** | No inventory; accounts mixed | Partial account listing | Identity-asset mapping established | Full inventory incl. privileges & sessions | Dynamic, contextual identity risk profiling |
| **Detection Coverage** | No logs collected | Some logs (e.g. AD) ingested | Baseline behavior rules defined | Real-time detection + behavior analytics | Cross-domain anomaly detection, LLM/graph-powered |
| **Response Mechanism** | No process | Email alerts, ad-hoc reactions | SOP-based manual responses (lockout/reset) | Semi-automated via SOAR/playbooks | Closed-loop auto-response with risk-adaptive policy |
| **Automation & Intelligence** | None | None | Scripted/manual triggers | Risk scoring & policy-based automation | ML/graph analysis, self-learning detection engine |

## Evaluation Checklist

Create a checklist (e.g., YAML or JSON) to self-assess each dimension:

```yaml
identity_visibility:
  - [ ] Do you maintain an up-to-date inventory of all identities (human + machine)?
  - [ ] Are privileged accounts clearly identified and tracked?
  - [ ] Are service accounts and their owners documented?
  - [ ] Can you trace which identities access which systems (identity-to-asset mapping)?

detection_coverage:
  - [ ] Are identity-related logs (e.g., AD, PAM, VPN, Jump server) being collected?
  - [ ] Are there rules to detect lateral movement and privilege escalation?
  - [ ] Do you have baselines for normal user behavior (e.g., login times, locations)?
  - [ ] Are high-risk activities (e.g., password dump, multiple failed logins) being monitored?

response_mechanism:
  - [ ] Is there a documented SOP for responding to identity-related incidents?
  - [ ] Can you manually disable, lock, or reset accounts based on alerts?
  - [ ] Are identity alerts routed via a ticketing system or SOAR playbook?
  - [ ] Is there a review/escalation process when privileged accounts are involved?

automation_intelligence:
  - [ ] Do you apply risk scoring to users based on behavior or context?
  - [ ] Are responses automated in part (e.g., auto-disable, MFA challenges)?
  - [ ] Can your detection model adapt over time based on new inputs or feedback?
```

## How to Use This

- Start by mapping your current state to each dimension and level.
- Identify the lowest dimension to determine your **overall maturity floor**.
- Plan improvements dimension-by-dimension using this toolkit as a roadmap.

You can extend this repository with:
- JSON/YAML-based self-assessment form
- Python script to generate a spider chart of maturity
- Integration checklist with IAM / PAM / SIEM / SOAR
