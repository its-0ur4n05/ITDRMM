# ITDR Maturity Model - Self Assessment Checklist
# Version: 2.0
# Last updated: Aug 2025
# Usage: Answer each question with true/false or yes/no


identity_governance:
  - question: Is there a centralized identity source (e.g., directory, IGA platform) managing all identities?
  - question: Are identity lifecycle events (provisioning, deprovisioning, transfers) automated or workflow-driven?
  - question: Are there regular access reviews and certification processes?
  - question: Is there governance over privilege escalation and role assignment?
  - question: Are identity policies dynamically enforced (e.g., based on risk or context)?


system_coverage:
  - question: Are all critical systems (e.g., AD, VPN, cloud, SaaS, PAM, bastion) integrated with identity monitoring?
  - question: Is log data from both on-premises and cloud platforms being collected and normalized?
  - [question: Can identity activity be correlated across different systems or domains?
  - question: Is integration regularly updated to reflect changes in infrastructure or new systems?


identity_asset_visibility:
  - question: Is there an up-to-date inventory of all identities, including service and machine accounts?
  - question: Are entitlements, privileges, and roles mapped to each identity?
  - question: Can you view active login sessions and their associated assets?
  - question: Is there visibility into identity relationships (e.g., ownership, group memberships, delegated access)?
  - question: Can historical identity activity be reconstructed for investigation?


detection_and_analytics:
  - question: Are identity-related logs (e.g., AD, PAM, VPN, SaaS) actively monitored?
  - question: Are there detection rules or UEBA models for common threats (e.g., lateral movement, impersonation)?
  - question: Are anomalies in login behavior, permission use, and session context detected?
  - question: Is detection enriched with context like user risk level, privilege type, or historical behavior?
  - question: Are detection models self-learning or adjusted based on feedback?


response_capability:
  - question: Is there an SOP for identity-related security incidents?
  - question: Are alerts for identity threats routed to appropriate teams (e.g., via ticket or SOAR)?
  - question: Can responders take immediate actions (e.g., disable account, rotate keys) in response to alerts?
  - question: Is incident response partially or fully automated for high-risk identity events?
  - question: Is there a closed-loop feedback mechanism from response outcomes to improve detection?
