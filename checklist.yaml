# ITDR Maturity Model - Self Assessment Checklist
# Version: 1.0
# Last updated: July 2025
# Usage: Answer each question with true/false or yes/no

identity_visibility:
  - question: Do you maintain an up-to-date inventory of all identities (human + machine)?
  - question: Are privileged accounts clearly identified and categorized?
  - question: Are service accounts and their owners documented?
  - question: Can you trace which identities access which systems (identity-to-asset mapping)?


detection_coverage:
  - question: Are identity-related logs (e.g., AD, PAM, VPN, Jump server) being collected?
  - question: Are there rules to detect lateral movement and privilege escalation?
  - question: Do you have baselines for normal user behavior (e.g., login times, locations)?
  - question: Are high-risk activities (e.g., password dump, multiple failed logins) being monitored?


response_mechanism:
  - question: Is there a documented SOP for responding to identity-related incidents?
  - question: Can you manually disable, lock, or reset accounts based on alerts?
  - question: Are identity alerts routed via a ticketing system or SOAR playbook?
  - question: Is there a review/escalation process when privileged accounts are involved?


automation_intelligence:
  - question: Do you apply risk scoring to users based on behavior or context?
  - question: Are responses automated in part (e.g., auto-disable, MFA challenges)?
  - question: Are graph-based or ML techniques used for behavioral anomaly detection?
  - question: Can your detection model adapt over time based on new inputs or feedback?
